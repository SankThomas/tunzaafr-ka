        Trust Fund is a special project of Tunza Afr!ka. The Trust Fund was
        established in June 2020 to respond creatively to the COVID-19 pandemic.
        It is a long-term initiative intended to support leadership and
        innovation in villages, informal settlements and other spaces where the
        spirit of resilience and creativity is most evident in various parts of
        Kenya.

        The
        <span>Tunza</span>
        Trust Fund support individuals, agencies and communities to enhance
        their creativity and innovation in challenging environments. The Trust
        Fund is led by individuals who strongly believe that the emergency
        response to COVID-19 needs to be accompanied by a robust long term
        program to enable individual and communities “get back to their feet”
        and thrive.
